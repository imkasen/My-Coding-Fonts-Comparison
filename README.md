# My Coding Fonts Comparison

A comparison of some of my commonly used programming fonts.

I've been using **Source Code Pro** as the coding font for the past few years, but since it doesn't support ligatures, I recently started trying to replace it with **Fira Code**. I've also tried **JetBrains Mono** and **Cascadia Code** before, but since I like thin fonts and these two fonts are slightly thick, I didn't use them as IDE and editor fonts. But for the command-line interface, I choose to use **Cascadia Code PL**...

## Fira Code Stylistic Sets

VS Code: `"editor.fontLigatures": "'ss01', 'ss03', 'ss05', 'ss06', 'zero'"`

## Update

Current font configuration:

* IDE / Editor: Fira Code Custom
* Terminal: Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font
* Chinese: Noto Sans SC
